# REST Bookstore API

This is a RESTful API that allows an end user to create and account and book orders for that account.

## Developing locally

When you have [installed Encore](https://encore.dev/docs/install), you can run this Encore application with this command.

```bash
encore run
```

While `encore run` is running, open [http://localhost:9400/](http://localhost:9400/) to view Encore's [local developer dashboard](https://encore.dev/docs/observability/dev-dash). From their you can interact with the api.

## Testing

```bash
encore test ./...
```
